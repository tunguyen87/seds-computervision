Course Description
======
This course is a one-semester course intended for graduate students in Computer Science and Data Science programs. It enhances the student’s knowledge in computer vision concepts and approaches such as image formation, camera imaging geometry, feature detection and matching, stereo, image classification, scene understanding, and deep learning. In class, we will develop the intuitions and mathematics of the vision approaches. We will expose students to a number of real-world applications that are important to our daily lives. To further differentiate between theory and practice, we will guide students through a series of assignments and projects such that they will have chance to implement cutting-edge computer vision algorithms. Students will also gain experience through research papers, with an emphasis on proper computer vision practices with appropriate applications.

**Due to COVID-19, this fall we will be conducting the course solely online... there will be no "in person" meetings. The online materials which we have created are the primary content for the course, and your primary interactions with the instuctor or TA will be via Piazza.**

Course aims
======
The aims of the course are:
1. to expose students to various computer vision concepts and approaches such as image formation, feature detection and matching, stereo, motion estimation and tracking, image classification, scene understanding, and deep learning
1. to familiarize students with state-of-the-art computer vision techniques
1. to present students the various ways to further improve the performance of state-of-the-art computer vision techniques

Course learning outcomes 
======
By the end of the course the student will be expected to be able:
1.	to understand and explain concepts related to computer vision such as image formation, feature detection and matching, stereo, image classification, scene understanding, and deep learning.
1.	to be able to recognize and describe both the theoretical and practical aspects of computing with images. 
1.	to be able to successfully implement several interesting and cutting-edge vision algorithms which are widely used in real-world applications such as image retrieval, image captioning, face recognition, scene categorization, and activity recognition. 
1.	to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various computer vision approaches and apply them to new scenarios.
1.	to be able to read and understand scholarly articles in computer vision and come up with new ideas to solve the same problem, which may lead students to write their research paper in computer vision. 

Pre-requisites
======
A good working knowledge of Python, Linear algebra, Vector calculus, and basic probability/statistics,.

Course materials
======
The primary course resources are provided online via the CSCI 585 webpages which contain video lessons, lecture slides, practice exercises, notes, and further readings created by the instructors, as well as links to off-site resources.

We will also be using the Piazza platform for handling general questions and answers from students.

We do not have a regular textbook for the course, though the following may be used as an occasional reference: 
- Simon Prince, “Computer Vision: Models, Learning, and Inference”, Cambridge University Press, 2012.
- Richard Szeliski, “Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications”, Springer, 2011.
- Forsyth and Ponce, “Computer Vision: A Modern Approach”, Prentice Hall, 2002,
- Murphy, Kevin P. “Machine learning: a probabilistic perspective”. MIT press, 2012.
- State-of-the-art paper readings

Course structure
======
This semester, the course will be completely online. The pages linked from the “Lecture Schedule” page provide materials for the individual lessons, which consist of on-line videos and/or readings.  Given that we do not have in-person lectures to help keep you on schedule, you will need to pay particular attention to when you need to go through the posted lesson materials according to the schedule, and properly pace yourself. Since we do not have in-person lectures, students are primarily responsible for getting help from the instructor (or TAs) when they are having difficulties. The best place to do this in Piazza, either by posting “publically” or “private to instructors”.  Note that you are not allowed to post your own assignment code to Piazza, so such questions must always be “prviate to instructors”.  Also, students are strongly encouraged to take part in discussions on Piazza, and help answer general questions…. just do not post code or give out answers to the assignments.

**Programming assignments.** This semester, we have planned several programming assignments which will be closely related to the topical material covered in the lectures. We will make a general announcement on Piazza when a programming assignment is posted on the webpages. These will need to be completed and submitted to Moodle by the given date and time. These programming exercises and assignments are essential to proper understanding of the contents of the course, so they are not optional. You may be “invited” for a Zoom meeting to explain or discuss code that has been submitted to Moodle if we have any outstanding questions about your submission or want to give direct feedback. If you are caught plagiarizing code from other students, or use code obtained online, or get unauthorized help from others, or are the provider of code or unauthorized help to others, you will get a zero for the “Programming Assignment” grade. Again, if you are having specific problems with programming assignments, posting “private to instructors” questions on Piazza is the appropriate way to get help.  Please do not email instructor or TAs directly for help.

**Homework.** Besides the programming assigments, you have several written assignments or homeworks during this semester. Each homework is centered around an application and will also deepen your understanding of the theoretical concepts. Homeworks should be written up clearly and concisely. You may lose points if your answers are unclear or unnecessarily complicated. Also, they must be scanned (or typed) and submitted before the given deadline to Moodle. 

**Midterm exam.** We will be having an online Moodle exam. Students cannot use notes, books, software, or other online materials or aids (e.g., an IDE) during the quiz. In some instances, we may allow the use of scratch paper to help you work out your solutions. The individual quizzes will be cumulative in the material covered up to the current point in the schedule. You will be required to record yourself during the exam so we can see both you and your computer desktop. Further details will be provided on Piazza about how to install the proper software, and what procedures you need to follow. 

**Final term project.** The final project will provide an opportunity for you to use the popular tools to build interesting applications of computer vision. Projects should be done in groups of up to four. For the project, you will be given a list of topics and choose one that you prefer working on, or you can also propose the new topic which must be closely related to the content of the course. In the end, each group is required to write a report in IEEE format and prepare the presentation as well as the demo of their chosen project. All groups must submit the same basic amount of work detailed in each item (i.e., report, presentaion, and demo) and will be graded on the same criteria. 

Assessment
======
Your final grade will be calculated as follows:
- Programming Assignments: 25%
- Homework: 20%
- Midterm-Exam: 25%
- Final term project: 30%
- Extra Credit (projects well-written in IEEE conf. format and quality): 10%

Final letter grades will be assigned using the following:
- A :     95 or above
- A-:    90 up to 95
- B+:    85 up to 90
- B :    80 up to 85
- B-:    75 up to 80
- C+:    70 up to 75
- C :    65 up to 70
- C-:    60 up to 65
- D+:    55 up to 60
- D :    50 up to 55
- F :    0 up to 50
