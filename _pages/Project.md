In the final project, you will work in groups of up to four to apply the techniques that you've learned in this class to the design of interesting of computer vision applications. For the project, you will be given a list of topics and choose one that you prefer working on, or you can also propose the new topic which must be closely related to the content of the course. In the end, each group is required to write a report in IEEE format and prepare the presentation as well as the demo of their chosen project. All groups must submit the same basic amount of work detailed in each item (i.e., report, presentaion, and demo) and will be graded on the same criteria. Note that all projects require to spend a decent minimum effort towards gathering data, and setting up the infrastructure to reach some form of result. 

You will build a system to solve a well-defined task. Which task you choose is completely open-ended, but the methods you use should be closely related to on the ones from the course.

Instructions for Final Project Report
======

1. Write an executive summary which is no more than 250 words to describe your overall project, the approach, the highlights of your discoveries/key findings, and your overall result. This is a short abstract in effect that summarizes the entire report.

2. Introduction – approximately half  page on describing the problem, and what your objectives are, and the techniques you considered for solving the problem. 
3. Technical Description – at most 2 page on the technical approach, describe the architecture, and the algorithm(s) in sufficient detail. Describe any innovations and contributions you made to the algorithms. Describe the end to end process for detection and classification. Recall, you are to use separate detection and classification stages. The detector should nominate a region of interest, and the classifier must provide the class label. Use figures as appropriate to illustrate the approach. You may have tried several approaches, but in this section limit it to your final solution/algorithms.
4. Data set – approximately half page description of the data (including training and testing sets). Use figures as needed to show examples of the data
5. Results –  At most 2 pages to describe your results focusing on detection and recognition. Describe the metrics to be used, and present the results obtained using these metrics (e.g. ROC curves, confusion matrices, location accuracy, detection and recognition performance, IoU, map, etc).  Use figures and tables as necessary to show quantitative results.
6. Conclusions – at most 1 page on your key conclusions, the insights into the problem (i.e. what worked and what didn’t), and the key limitations/advantages of your approach. Remember it is valuable to know the  bottlenecks and challenges, and what you did to overcome them. List your discoveries along the way.
7. Any appropriate references
8. Submit the source code and executable that can be used for testing, along with a sample image or two on which the code can be run to observe the results. If you use video, then submit a video sequence on which the code can be run. The results should be clear (such as detections and class labels annotated on the image, and printed on the screen).
