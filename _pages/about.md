Course Description
======
This course is a one-semester course intended for M.S. students in Computer Science and Data Science graduate programs. It enhances the student’s knowledge in computer vision concepts and approaches such as image formation, camera imaging geometry, feature detection and matching, stereo, image classification, scene understanding, and deep learning. In class, we will develop the intuitions and mathematics of the vision approaches. We will expose students to a number of real-world applications that are important to our daily lives. To further differentiate between theory and practice, we will guide students through a series of research projects such that they will have chance to implement cutting-edge computer vision algorithms. Students will also gain experience through research papers, with an emphasis on proper computer vision practices with appropriate applications.

**Due to COVID-19, this fall we will be conducting the course solely online... there will be no "in person" meetings. The online materials which we have created are the primary content for the course, and your primary interactions with the instuctor or TA will be via Piazza.**

Course aims
======
1. to expose students to various computer vision concepts and approaches such as image formation, feature detection and matching, stereo, motion estimation and tracking, image classification, scene understanding, and deep learning

1.	to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various computer vision approaches and apply them to new scenarios.
1.	to be able to read and understand scholarly articles in computer vision and come up with new ideas to solve the same problem, which may lead students to write their research paper in computer vision. 

Pre-requisites
======
Basic Probability/Statistics, a good working knowledge of Python, Linear algebra, Vector calculus.

Course materials
======
The primary course resources are provided online via the CSCI 585 webpages.  You can self-register for access to the webpages, but if you have any trouble, contact your instructor as soon as possible.  The CSCI 585 webpages contain video lessons, lecture slides, practice exercises, notes, and further readings created by the instructors, as well as links to off-site resources.

We will also be using the Piazza platform for handling general questions and answers from students.

We do not have a regular textbook for the course, though the following may be used as an occasional reference: 
- Simon Prince, “Computer Vision: Models, Learning, and Inference”, Cambridge University Press, 2012.
- Richard Szeliski, “Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications”, Springer, 2011.
- Forsyth and Ponce, “Computer Vision: A Modern Approach”, Prentice Hall, 2002,
- Murphy, Kevin P. “Machine learning: a probabilistic perspective”. MIT press, 2012.
- State-of-the-art paper readings

Course structure
======
This semester, the course will be completely online. The pages linked from the “Lecture Schedule” page provide materials for the individual lessons, which consist of on-line videos and/or readings.  Given that we do not have in-person lectures to help keep you on schedule, you will need to pay particular attention to when you need to go through the posted lesson materials according to the schedule, and properly pace yourself. Since we do not have in-person lectures, students are primarily responsible for getting help from the instructors or TAs when they are having difficulties. The best place to do this in Piazza, either by posting “publically” or “private to instructors”.  Note that you are not allowed to post your own assignment code to Piazza, so such questions must always be “prviate to instructors”.  Also, students are strongly encouraged to take part in discussions on Piazza, and help answer general questions…. just do not post code or give out answers to the assignments.

**Programming assignments.** This semester, we have planned several programming assignments which will be closely related to the topical material covered in the lectures. We will make a general announcement on Piazza when a programming assignment is posted on the webpages. These will need to be completed and submitted to Moodle by the given date and time. These programming exercises and assignments are essential to proper understanding of the contents of the course, so they are not optional. You may be “invited” for a Zoom meeting to explain or discuss code that has been submitted to Moodle if we have any outstanding questions about your submission or want to give direct feedback. If you are caught plagiarizing code from other students, or use code obtained online, or get unauthorized help from others, or are the provider of code or unauthorized help to others, you will get a zero for your entire “Programming Assignment” grade. Again, if you are having specific problems with programming assignments, posting “private to instructors” questions on Piazza is the appropriate way to get help.  Please do not email instructors or TAs directly for help.

**Homework.** Besides the programming assigments, you have several written assignments or homeworks during this semester. Each homework is centered around an application and will also deepen your understanding of the theoretical concepts. Homeworks should be written up clearly and concisely. You may lose points if your answers are unclear or unnecessarily complicated. Also, they must be scanned (or typed) and submitted before the given deadline to Moodle. 

**Final term project.** The final project will provide an opportunity for you to use the popular tools to build interesting applications of computer vision. Projects should be done in groups of up to three. For the project, you will be given a list of topics and choose one that you prefer working on, or you can also propose the new topic which must be closely related to the content of the course. In the end, each group is required to write a report in IEEE format and prepare the presentation as well as the demo of their chosen project. All groups must submit the same basic amount of work detailed in each item (i.e., report, presentaion, and demo) and will be graded on the same criteria. 

Assessment
======
Your final grade will be calculated as follows:
- Programming Assignments: 25%
- Homework: 20%
- Midterm-Exam: 25%
- Final term project: 30%
- Extra Credit (projects well-written in IEEE conf. format and quality): 15%

Final letter grades will be assigned using the following:
- A     95 or above
- A-    90 up to 95
- B+    85 up to 90
- B     80 up to 85

- D     50 up to 55
- F     0 up to 50

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
