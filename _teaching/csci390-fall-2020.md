The focus of this course is to introduce and familiarize the student with basic concepts of Artificial Intelligence including but not limited to Problem Solving, Reasoning, Probabilistic Reasoning and Learning, Learning from Observation, Neural Network. The student will be exposed to these traditional fields in order to understand many of the commonly used algorithms in computer science, robotics or data mining. The preferred programming language is Python but beside one or two assignments Java or C/C++ is allowed as well.

Instructors
======
* Professor Dinh-Mao Bui
* Professor Nguyen Anh Tu

Office Hours
======
* From 3 PM to 4 PM, Tuesday and Thursday.
* Link for weekly sign-up: [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PgTaNsYHiomK5GQ4gE3XulAQC0ZdspXwY9he8OdcY3A/edit?usp=sharing) 

Pre-Requisites
======
CSCI-152 Performance and Data Structures (C- and above). This is a MUST.

Course Aims
======
The aims of the course are:
* Learn and Understand what is AI, what are intelligent agents and how are they used in problem solving.
* Learn how to solve problems by searching, exploration vs. exploitation in strategies for problem solving, and so on
* Reasoning under uncertain conditions (probabilistic reasoning)
* Learning (from observation, probabilistic, reinforcement)
* To be equipped with the tools to tackle new AI problems you might encounter in life.

Course Materials
======
The required textbook for this course is: “Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 2nd/3rd edition, Stuart Russell, Peter Norvig.”

Course Assessment
======
The final grade is calculated as follows:
* Two 10-minute quizzes 10% (in case of first quiz exempted, the second quiz will be counted as 10%)
* One mid-term 15%
* Nine assignments 45%
* One final examination 30% (including all the content from the beginning to the end)  

Note 1: students from other departments are graded the same as Computer Science students, no exception, no negotiation.  
Note 2: exams can be given out of class time and venue according to the duration of exam and/or the availability of the location. In this case, we will inform at least one week before the exams. Student with spravka/valid reason MUST inform the instructors right before the quiz/exams for being considered. Late report is not accepted.
